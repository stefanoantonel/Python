<h4>What our Users write about S.O.S. Mathematics:</h4>
<p class="justified">
Being a dedicated internet enthusiast, it was a no-brainer to choose a 
topic for my extra-credit assignment. I've been cruising the web all semester 
for math sites and have found the one reported on here to be most helpful. 
S.O.S. Mathematics is the worldwide web site of the Department of Mathematical Sciences at 
The University of Texas at El Paso. It was created by education and mathematics professors 
at the school, along with help from students there. During the past two months I've been using 
the site and have found it to be quite helpful. Several features in particular have made it 
especially interesting and enjoyable. The style of the site---its layout and language---make 
it very easy to move through. The information is relevant and presented in a 
straightforward and engaging tone. Two particularly helpful features offered are the 
"cyber exams" which allow one to be tested on-line ( a first-time experience for me) and 
links to other math sites and discussion groups on the web. Although I certainly would not suggest 
it as a substitute for a good math text and a (living!) teacher, I would strongly recommend 
this site to anyone wanting to augment and enhance their classwork with  computerized learning. 
It is nice to know that as more and more learning becomes computerized that we can look 
forward to experiences like S.O.S. Mathematics. If this is somehow emblematic of the 
"brave new world" I say, Bring it on!

Congratulations. Your page is exactly what I was looking for. 
I navigated in the www for hours before finding your page.<br>
Best Regards

Awesome site, keep up the great work.
I use the Math help as a reference for my students! They love it!<br>
Thanks<br>

THANK YOU for having the webpage you have! I've got a book named College 
Algebra and it [deleted], as far as I'm concerned they could navigate their 
students to your webpage instead cause it simplifies and thoroughly 
explains equations they way they are supposed to be!<br>
Thanks!

Super site--just found it today! I like the clean look and useful content.
I've already suggested the site to my daughter (calculus) and will pass the
URL along to my students (college algebra). I'll look for additional blue
printing on your pages.

i think that it is wonderful that you have such a wonderful web site. My
algebra teacher introduced your site to us. THANX AGAIN!!!

You made a Saturday math assignment for a seventh grader doing fractions
very clear. My dad and I were stumped. We just typed in "Dividing
Fractions" and there was your page.

I am the mother of three (two college-aged and one in jr high) and this
home page of SOS enables me to review and understand math I took 20
years ago.  It's fabulous.  I don't dare tell my husband who is a
mathematician why I am able to discuss his actuarial topics these days. 
<br>
Thanks much.  Sincerely,

This is the best math site on the net by far.  It is easy to navigate,
provides an ample number of examples, and downloads quickly.  I am taking the
GMAT in March and came across your site via EXCITE! just in time to help me
study for the test....<br>
Finally, I noticed your counter said I was the 4089th vister to the site
since 8/96.  This is an incredibly low number considering the magnificent
scope of information you provide.  Maybe the marketing students could work on
that for you.
